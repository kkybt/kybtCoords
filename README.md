# kybtCoords
A Minecraft mod which displays your coordinates in the corner of your screen, along with a few other bits of information. There are three commands you can use to configure the mod, those commands and their functions will be listed below:

/kybtcoords toggle - Toggles the mod on or off.  
/kybtcoords config - Allows you to customize the appearance and the listed information of the coordinates box.  
/kybtcoords position - Allows you to change the position of the coordinates box with a simple click and drag mechanic.  

This mod is only compatible with Minecraft version 1.8.9

If you want to use the mod, I'll get around to adding a download link at some point. In the meantime, however, you'll have to compile the source code yourself.
