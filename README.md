# kybtCoords
A Minecraft mod which displays your coordinates in the corner of your screen.

This mod is only compatible with Minecraft version 1.8.9

If you want to use the mod, I'll get around to adding a download link at some point. In the meantime, however, you'll have to compile the source code yourself.
